# Seattle_Airbnb_Analysis
This project uses the Seattle Airbnb Open Data from kaggle.com, providing three datasets listings.csv, calendar.csv and reviews.csv.

## Project Content:
  1. Data Exploration, listing.csv and calendar.csv.
  2. Data preparation for modelling,
  3. sklearn linear regression model,

Further work will be to use different regression model on the data find the best method.

As a first project I hope that this can help those starting as I am the oppotunity to make the leap and get into a project.
